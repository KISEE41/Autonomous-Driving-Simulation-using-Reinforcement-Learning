# Autonomous Vehicle Simulation using Reinforcement Learning

In this project, the agent (ie vehicle) learns to follow the lane by itself using Reinforcement Learning. 

The simulation environment was made using unity3D package **CiDY** in unity3D. S0, to run the project **CiDY** package must be installed in unity3D editor.
